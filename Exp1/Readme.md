## 📖 Experiment Overview

This is my first experiment in the Full Stack Development course where I've created a comprehensive personal portfolio website using HTML. The portfolio showcases my skills, projects, qualifications, and professional experience in a structured and organized manner.

The website is styled using an external CSS file (`style.css`) which employs modern design principles such as CSS variables, Google Fonts, and responsive layouts to provide a sleek, user-friendly interface.
